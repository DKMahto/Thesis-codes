# Role of Medium-Duration Energy Storage: Compressed Air Energy Storage and Carnot Battery
Medium-duration energy storage model based on PyPSA-Eur and results analyses

## Abstract
Energy storage technologies are recognized as effective solutions during energy transition. However, previous studies focused on cost assessment for one type of technologies, or were based on one or several regions. Here, we use PyPSA-Eur with high spatio-temporal resolution to explore the role of medium-duration energy storage (MDES) technologies in the European electricity system, alongside Li-ion battery and hydrogen as short-and long-term energy storage. The evaluation method combines system value analysis with market potential approach within feasible regions derived from technology future design space, i.e. compressed ais energy storage (CAES), Carnot batteries (including pumped thermal energy storage (PTES), liquid air energy storage (LAES)) as well as vanadium redox flow battery.
